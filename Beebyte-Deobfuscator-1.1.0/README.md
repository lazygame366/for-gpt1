Its common for mobile games to be compiled with the gcc compiler while msvc is used for windows this causes compatability issues so you cannot use this plugin across compilers.  
This feature may come in the future.

If you select Il2Cpp make sure to select a un-obfuscated GameAssembly.dll and global-metadata.dat or an android Package file.  
If you select Mono make sure to select an un-obfuscated mono compiled Assembly-CSharp.dll located in the games Managed folder.  

The naming regex should correspond to the naming scheme of the Beebyte configuration.  
For example:  
NJGFKJNAEMN: `^[A-Z]{11}$` (Among Us)  
u091Eu091Fu0927u0924u0929u0927u0920u0928u0926u091Cu091D: `^[\u0900-\u097F]{11}$` (Phasmaphobia)  
UOiWPrj: `^[A-Za-\u0082\[\]\^]{7}$` (Garena Free Fire)

## Exports
